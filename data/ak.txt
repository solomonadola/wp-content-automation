Solmon Adola
Software Engineer

About Me:
I am a production geologist and geomodeller with a strong focus on technical excellence, attention to detail, and value creation. With over 10 years of experience in the oil and gas industry, I have honed my skills in sub-surface geo-modeling, integrated reservoir studies, field development planning, and operations geology. My track record includes successfully interpreting some of the largest and most complex Nigerian fields. Backed by solid credentials (BSc Geology, MSc Pet. Geoscience) and proficiency in industry-standard geo-modeling tools, I am committed to delivering exceptional results and have been recognized with special awards for my technical excellence and value creation. As the Young Professional Lead for the Africa Region in the AAPG, I stay actively engaged in professional development and industry advancements.

What I Do:
Production Geology: Collecting and analyzing geological and production data, building static reservoir models, and supporting reservoir engineering and well reservoir management activities.
Field Development Planning: Providing geology input to field development projects, including integrated reservoir modeling, seismic interpretation, and opportunity identification.
3D Static Modelling: Constructing detailed 3D reservoir models for oil and gas reservoirs, optimizing field development plans and reducing well costs.
Reserves Evaluation: Ensuring compliant evaluation and reporting of reserves portfolios through auditable methods, volumetric analysis, and performance-based assessments.
Operations Geology: Overseeing well delivery operations, including well planning, drilling risk analysis, well-site data acquisition, and well completion support.
